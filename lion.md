Lion (Panthera leo) lying down in Namibia. Photographer's comment: "[I was] standing on a viewing platform about 25m away. He wasn't doing much at all other than looking regal. There where [sic] some lionesses down below growling and pacing but they were in the shade so I didn't get very good pictures of them. [...] They were from Okinjima AfriCat foundation who look after injured or orphaned cats until they can be returned to the wild. They also educate farmers on practices on how to raise stock with large cats."
